# ThinkfulFinalCapstone
This Notebook was created for my Final Capstone Project in Thinkful's Data Analytics course.
In it, I analyze two datasets containing records of all occurrences of an individual being killed by a US police officer since 2000. My main research question revolves around the demographics of the individuals on this list and how often police use excessive deadly force (shooting someone who isn't armed with a gun) across certain demographics. I used statistical analysis and hypothesis testing to measure proportions along the race, gender, and mental illness categories.
