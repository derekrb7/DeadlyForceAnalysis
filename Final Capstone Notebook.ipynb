men.\n"," - Historically, it is more likely that someone exhibiting signs of mental illness, even without a gun, is more likely to be shot and killed by US police than a gunless individual who does not show signs of mental illness.\n"," - Age of the victim doesn't seem to make a difference in proportions.\n","\n","Based on my findings, I would recommend that police departments\n"," - take steps to ensure that officers receive extensive training on use-of-force, as over half of the people shot and killed by US police since 2000 were not armed with a gun and therefore, less likely to be an immediate, instant threat\n"," - include required cultural and sensitivity training and testing for officers to help combat and eliminate bias, prejudice, and racism in the police force\n"," - start dispatching mental health professionals with officers on appropriate calls to counteract the EDF proportion rates of people who show signs of mental illness.\n"],"metadata":{"id":"4lsTHl4Q_FQc"}}]}
